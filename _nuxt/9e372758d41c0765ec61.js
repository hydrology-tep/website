This event was held in Wuhan, China from the 4th until the 8th.\n\n![](HTEP_News_ESA_2016_dragon3.jpg)\n\nThe Symposium ended the 3rd cycle of the Dragon Program and launched the 4th one. Dragon is a collaborative effort of ESA and the National Remote Sensing Centre of China (NRSCC).\n\nModeling cryospheric and hydrospheric processes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales using a very diverse suite of ESA and Chinese satellite data is the focus of the Dragon Hydrospheric and Cryospheric Community. The presentation led a very interested audience to ask several questions, which were a clear indication of the potential relevance of the Hydrology TEP to the community.\n\nMore information about the event is available at: [](url)http://earth.esa.int/dragon-2016/\n\n\n\n",summaryImage:"HTEP_News_Wuhan.jpg",title:"Presentation of Hydrology TEP at Dragon 3 Final Results Symposium",summary:"In July 2016, the Hydrology TEP was presented at the Dragon 3 Final Results Symposium in Wuhan (China)."},prevStoryId:"esa-open-science-2017",nextStoryId:"presentation-kampala-aarse-2016"}}}}]);
