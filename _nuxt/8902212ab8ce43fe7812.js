Held at the Melnikov Permafrost Institute (MPI), the workshop was focused on the Arctic Earth Observation (EO) Network that will be soon fully available at the Hydrology TEP.\n\nThe workshop “Satellite water level observations to support flood forecasting and hydrological research in Yakutian rivers”, was organized by David Gustafsson from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and Lyudmila Lebedeva from the Melnikov Permafrost Institute (MPI). \n\nThe workshop consisted of a seminar, in which the Hydrology TEP and the Arctic EO Network use case were presented, and a discussion that was lead by Professor Viktor Shepelev (MPI). The topics covered included: flood forecasting in Yakutia, water level observation using satellite radar altimetry and the use of water level data in hydrological modelling.\n\n![](News_Workshop_Arctic_EO.jpg)\n"}}}}}}]);
