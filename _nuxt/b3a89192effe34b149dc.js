For H-TEP, the most relevant goal is SDG 6, which aims at ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (UN Water, 2018). In order to track progress of SDG 6, a list of global indicators is defined. These should aid policy- and decision-makers in governmental agencies with the identification of challenges, opportunities, implementation, priority setting and progress monitoring.
