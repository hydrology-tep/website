There is a great need for reliable access to operational flood forecasts and alerts, produced by a robust information and communication system, adapted to regional conditions and operated by capable West African institutions.\n\nThe EC-funded FANFAR project aims at building such a system. In this context, Lobelia's satellite-based water level products of the Niger River basin floodplain are sequentially assimilated into a hydrological model from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) to generate river discharge return periods. These results are then used in SMHIâ€™s flood forecasting and early-warning alert system in West Africa.\n\n",rank:20,summary:"Floods are a rapidly growing concern in West Africa, projected to increase with climate change.
