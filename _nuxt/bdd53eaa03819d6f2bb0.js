The results that users can obtain have been refined with data from Sentinel-1 GRD and from the MODIS archive.\n\n- It is also possible to monitor floods and display a detailed mapping of the affected areas at high resolution. Results have been refined with data from Sentinel-1 and optical imagery.\n\n- The assessment of the water extent and floods evolution over time can be done by using basic statistics such as flood and water frequency maps, maximum floodable area and time series. Advanced temporal statistics can also be analysed by means of trends.\n\n\nThe Flood Monitoring service is currently available for 2 regions:\n\n- Niger River\n- Red River\n\n\nIn order to get started with the Flood Monitoring service, you can [read the documentation](http://hydrology-tep.github.io/documentation/apps/fm.html) and the [service pricing](/guest/pricing#flood-monitoring).\n\n### Service specifications\n\n#### Outputs for Sentinel 1 SAR images Ground Range Detected (GRD)\n\n- Water masks\n- Reference mask\n- Water frequency maps\n- Flood maps\n- Flood frequency map\n- Maximum floodable area\n\n#### Outputs for Sentinel 2 Optical images\n\n- Water masks results refinement\n\n#### Outputs for ENVISAT ASAR\n\n- Historical analysis of floods (2003-2012) at medium resolution\n\n#### Outputs for MODIS archive\n\n- Results refinement of historical analysis of floods",developedBy:"altamira"},partners:[{id:"altamira",rank:80,name:"TRE Altamira",logoName:"altamira",url:"https://site.tre-altamira.com/",width:"4em",top:"0"}]}}}}]);
