There is a great need for reliable access to operational flood forecasts and alerts, produced by a robust information and communication system, adapted to regional conditions and operated by capable West African institutions.\n\nThe EC-funded FANFAR project aims at building such a system. In this context, Lobelia's satellite-based water level products of the Niger River basin floodplain are sequentially assimilated into a hydrological model from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) to generate river discharge return periods. These results are then used in SMHIâ€™s flood forecasting and early-warning alert system in West Africa.\n\n![West Africa](story1-img.png)\n\nThe cloud-based Hydrology Thematic Exploitation Platform (H-TEP) operates this flood warning system. Lobelia's satellite-based, global water level service runs on the H-TEP and is well-suited to complement in-situ sensor networks. It can also be used as a proxy of streamflow, for model calibration and validation as well as for hydrologic data assimilation.\n\n![Big image](https://files.isardsat.co.uk/web-htep/big-image.png)\n\n",summaryImage:"https://files.isardsat.co.uk/web-htep/big-image.png",rank:-30},prevStoryId:"reporting-the-2030-sustainable-development-goals-set-by-the-un",nextStoryId:"operating-a-flood-warning-system-in-north-africa"}}}}]);
