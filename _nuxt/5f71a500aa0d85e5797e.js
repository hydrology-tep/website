This processor includes sensor independent state of the art algorithms. Some of these are adjacency correction, coupled atmospheric in water retrieval considering all bidirectional aspects from extreme clean to extreme turbid case 2 waters in a physically correct approach.\n\nThe Water Quality service is currently available for 3 regions:\n\n- Niger River\n- Red River\n- Myanmar\n\nIn order to get started with the Water Quality service, you can [read the documentation](http://hydrology-tep.github.io/documentation/apps/wq.html).\n",developedBy:"eomap"}}}}}]);
