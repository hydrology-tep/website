This presentation concluded the Session after five presentations on different aspects of Copernicus and emphasized the evolution from large centralized data archiving and processing facilities and services towards user-driven and end-to-end exploitation of Earth Observation data.\n\nThis bi-annual international conference brought together over 600 scientists, practitioners, vendors of products and government officials from various countries across the globe. A large part of the first day was dedicated to the perspectives of cooperation in Earth Observation (EO) between Africa and China. One of the sub-themes was Management of Big Data and Spatial Data Infrastructure.
