It is both a threat and a blessing for human lives, agriculture and infrastructure. There is a great need for reliable access to operational flood forecasts and alerts produced by a robust information and communication technology (ICT) system adapted to regional conditions and operated by capable West African institutions.\n\n![](https://editorial.lobelia.earth:22105/web-files/News_Fanfar_floods.jpg)\n\nThe EC-funded FANFAR project is building an early-warning alert system in West Africa. The flood forecasting application offered in the Hydrology Thematic Exploitation Platform (H-TEP) is improved when calibrated with local discharge\nobservations or derived data from virtual stations to replace the simulated discharge in\nspecific areas along the Niger River.\n\n![](https://editorial.lobelia.earth:22105/web-files/News_Fanfar_floods_geobrowser.jpg)\n\nFANFAR is providing reliable and timely access to flood forecasts and alerts through a range of distribution channels to\nensure that the information actually reaches its target audience.\nThe distribution channels currently include web visualisation, SMS, e-mail, and Application Programming Interfaces (API). The forecasting system is based on an open-source hydrological model employed in a cloud-based Information and Communications Technology (ICT) environment to ensure operational robustness despite frequent cuts to electricity and internet supply in the region.\n\n",rank:0,summary:"Floods are a rapidly growing concern in West Africa, projected to increase with climate change.
