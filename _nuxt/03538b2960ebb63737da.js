Held at the Melnikov Permafrost Institute (MPI), the workshop was focused on the Arctic Earth Observation (EO) Network that will be soon fully available at the Hydrology TEP.\n\nThe workshop “Satellite water level observations to support flood forecasting and hydrological research in Yakutian rivers”, was organized by David Gustafsson from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and Lyudmila Lebedeva from the Melnikov Permafrost Institute (MPI). \n\nThe workshop consisted of a seminar, in which the Hydrology TEP and the Arctic EO Network use case were presented, and a discussion that was lead by Professor Viktor Shepelev (MPI). The topics covered included: flood forecasting in Yakutia, water level observation using satellite radar altimetry and the use of water level data in hydrological modelling.\n\n![](News_Workshop_Arctic_EO.jpg)\n"},"3rd-fanfar-workshop-nigeria":{id:"3rd-fanfar-workshop-nigeria",rank:40,title:"3rd FANFAR Workshop in Nigeria",summaryImage:"FANFAR_Workshop_Nigeria.jpg",summary:"The 3rd FANFAR Workshop took place in Nigeria in February 2020",body:"On 10-14 February 2020, the 3rd FANFAR Workshop took place in Abuja (Nigeria). \n\nFANFAR is an European Commission (EC) Horizon 2020 project that is focused on operational flood forecasting and alerts in West Africa. \n\nThe Hydrology TEP was used in some sessions of this workshop for flood forecasting services including satellite-based water level applications. Aytor Naranjo (isardSAT), Mélissande Machefer (isardSAT), Jafet Andersson (SMHI) and Emmanuel Mathot (Terradue), among other members from European and African institutions took part in this event and presented how the Hydrology TEP could be useful for participants.\n\n![](FANFAR_Workshop_Nigeria.jpg)\n\nPrevious to this event, the Hydrology TEP was already used in other FANFAR workshops such as the 1st FANFAR Flood Forecasting and Alerts Workshop in Niamey (Niger) on September 2018 and the 2nd FANFAR Co-design and training workshop in Accra (Ghana) on April 2019.\n"}}}}}}]);
