There is a great need for reliable access to operational flood forecasts and alerts, produced by a robust Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system, adapted to regional conditions and operated by West African institutions.\n\nThe FANFAR project, funded by the European Commission (EC) aims at building such a system. In this context, isardSAT's satellite-based water level products of the Niger River basin floodplain are sequentially assimilated into a hydrological model from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) to generate river discharge return periods. These results are then used in SMHI’s flood forecasting and early-warning alert system in West Africa.\n\n![West Africa](story1-img.png)\n\nThe Hydrology TEP operates this flood warning system, by running isardSAT's satellite-based, global water level service. This water level service is well-suited to complement in-situ sensor networks. It can also be used as a proxy of streamflow, for model calibration and validation as well as for hydrologic data assimilation.\n\nFANFAR is providing reliable and timely access to flood forecasts and alerts through a range of distribution channels to ensure that the information reaches its target audience. These distribution channels include web visualisations, SMS, e-mail and Application Programming interfaces (API).\n",summaryImage:"Stories_Darfur_Sudan.jpg",rank:-30},"reporting-the-2030-sustainable-development-goals-set-by-the-un":{id:"reporting-the-2030-sustainable-development-goals-set-by-the-un",body:"In the frame of this use case, satellite-based water monitoring services for inland and coastal waters are provided for selected number of pilot areas of major interest defined by the user.\u2028\n\nThe aims of the different Thematic Exploitation Platforms are often complementary to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the UN. For H-TEP, the most relevant goal is SDG 6, which aims at ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (UN Water, 2018). In order to track progress of SDG 6, a list of global indicators is defined. These should aid policy- and decision-makers in governmental agencies with the identification of challenges, opportunities, implementation, priority setting and progress monitoring. H-TEP is positioned to play an important role in a country’s journey towards achieving SDG 6 by contributing with the monitoring of several global indicators.",title:"Reporting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN",summaryImage:"Stories_UN_Hungary.jpg",rank:-20},"arctic-ocean":{id:"arctic-ocean",title:"Analysing fresh water flow to the Arctic Ocean for scientist",summaryImage:"Stories_Arctic.jpg",body:"Floods are a **rapidly growing** concern in East Africa, projected to increase with climate change.
